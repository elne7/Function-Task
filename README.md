# Function-Task

This task is practicing on the functions concept that makes a function gets the minimun number from a list of numbers

Here in my task I started making a list of integers that has 10 numbers

Then I went to make the function by initializing it and giving it an parameter that will hold the list

Inside the function, there is a variable the will be compered to the list

Then making a for loop to chenk on each number of the list that if it is smaller than the compered variable

At the end, when the compered variable meet with a smaller number it gets its value

Then the function return that value to the main function

Lastly in the main function, It prints the returned value using print statement
